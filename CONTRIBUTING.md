# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. We do have
some guidelines to follow, covered in this document, but don't worry about – or
expect to – get everything right the first time!

## Before you begin

### Review our community guidelines

We have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to make the Tesseract Decoder
project an open and welcoming community environment. Please make sure to read
and abide by our code of conduct.

## Contribution process

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use the tools provided by GitHub for [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for this
purpose. The preferred manner for submitting pull requests is to fork the
Tesseract Decoder [repository](https://github.com/quantumlib/tesseract-decoder),
create a [git
branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) in
this fork to do your work, and when ready, create a pull request from this
branch to the main Tesseract Decoder repository.
